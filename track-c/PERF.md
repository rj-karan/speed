# Track C: performance log

Every step from the reference to your final version, each with the live-board run ID that measured it. Judges check that the run IDs exist and that each change moved the way you say it did.

| Step | Change | Run ID | T (s) | M (MB) | Points |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | The reference, unchanged | | 14.44 | 367 | 0 |
| 1 | Replace per-record Python objects with a mapped CSV parser, indexed join, and per-country aggregates | pending board ID | pending | pending | pending |

Local `check.py` passed the official seed-1 full output hash
`d8088b1cd42ba1338b1345b107b55db7b96ef1f5066f3ff64fd26a8912a0f536`.
The local Docker check took 3.87 s including container startup; this is not a
board measurement and is not used as a judging claim.

Second local experiment: intern names globally and track country membership with
four 64-bit words per name. This replaces millions of per-country set nodes with
one state per name. The same full local sandbox check fell from 3.87 s to 2.15 s,
and the output hash stayed identical. The next board run will establish the
official time and memory effect.
